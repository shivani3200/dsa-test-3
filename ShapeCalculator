2. Create a superclass called Shape with an abstract method calculateArea() that returns the area of the shape.
Implement subclasses Rectangle, Circle, and Triangle that inherit from the Shape class. Implement the calculateArea() 
method in each subclass to calculate and return the area of a rectangle, circle, and triangle, respectively.
Then, create a class called ShapeCalculator with a method printArea(Shape shape) that accepts an object of type Shape and prints its area. 
Demonstrate polymorphism by passing instances of different subclasses to the printArea() method.


// Shape class
abstract class Shape {
    public abstract double calculateArea();
}

// Rectangle subclass
class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return length * width;
    }
}

// Circle subclass
class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

// Triangle subclass
class Triangle extends Shape {
    private double base;
    private double height;

    public Triangle(double base, double height) {
        this.base = base;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return 0.5 * base * height;
    }
}

// ShapeCalculator class
class ShapeCalculator {
    public void printArea(Shape shape) {
        double area = shape.calculateArea();
        System.out.println("The area of the shape is: " + area);
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate polymorphism
public class ShapeTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShapeCalculator calculator = new ShapeCalculator();

        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 4);
        calculator.printArea(rectangle); // Output: The area of the shape is: 20.0

        Shape circle = new Circle(3);
        calculator.printArea(circle);    // Output: The area of the shape is: 28.27433

        Shape triangle = new Triangle(6, 8);
        calculator.printArea(triangle);  // Output: The area of the shape is: 24.0
    }
}
